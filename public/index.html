      content="My name is Julien Gilbert. I graduated in 2024 with a Software Design degree from a renowned online school recognized across the internet. I started my coding journey as a completely self-taught developer, driven by my passion for learning and the boundless possibilities that coding offers to solve real-world problems. My goal is to improve every single day, contribute to ambitious and impactful projects, and keep pushing the boundaries of what technology can achieve.

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
