      Today, I want to share an approach that has transformed the way I build React components: the "Compound Component" pattern combined with the Context API. If you've ever worked on complex
      components like a Modal, you know that managing state and props can quickly become cumbersome.
    </p>

    <h2 className="mt-5 mb-4">Why This Pattern is a Game-Changer</h2>

    <div className="mb-4">
      <ol className="fs-5">
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>More intuitive and declarative API </strong> - The JSX structure directly reflects the visual structure.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Better flexibility and composition </strong> - Easily customize the order and inclusion of elements.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Separation of concerns</strong> - Each subcomponent has a unique responsibility.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Reduced prop drilling</strong> - The Context API eliminates the need to pass props deeply.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <h2 className="mt-5 mb-4">The Traditional Approach</h2>

    <p className="mb-3">Traditionally, we would implement a Modal like this:</p>

    <img className="mb-3 img-fluid w-100" src="/blog/article1/code1.webp" width={800} alt="code snippet" />

    <p className="mb-4">This approach works but becomes rigid when you want more customization.</p>

    <h2 className="mt-5 mb-4">Implementation with Compound Component + Context API</h2>

    <p className="mb-3">With the Compound Component pattern and Context API, we can transform this into a much more elegant API:</p>

    <h2 className="mt-5 mb-4">How to Use This Component</h2>

    <p className="mb-3">Here's how we now use our Modal with the Compound Component pattern:</p>

    <h2 className="mt-5 mb-4">Key Advantages of This Approach</h2>

    <div className="mb-5">
      <ul className="fs-5">
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Full control over structure</strong> - You can freely arrange your subcomponents as needed.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Intuitive API</strong> - The JSX structure naturally reflects the component’s visual structure.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>State isolation</strong> - The Context API manages internal state, making it accessible only where needed.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Extensibility </strong> - It’s easy to add new subcomponents without modifying existing code.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 className="mt-5 mb-4">Conclusion</h2>

    <p className="mb-4">
      This approach has allowed me to build more maintainable and flexible components that easily adapt to design changes. The Compound Component pattern combined with the Context API provides a
      better development experience while producing cleaner and more user-friendly code.
